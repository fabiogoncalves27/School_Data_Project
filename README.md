# Schools_Data_Project
Investigating School Projects Python Project

## Dataset:

The dataset used for this project were 6 .csv files named: 'Donations.csv', 'Donors.csv', 'Projects.csv', 'Resources.csv', 'Schools.csv' and 'Teachers.csv' that holds information about the school projects. You can consult the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of this dataset in the picture presented below:

## Objectives & Goals:

In this project, I used Visual Studio Code and created a Jupyter Notebook to manipulate the data of the csv files using Python.

    1: Which 10 states have the most number of schools that opened projects to gather donations ? 
    2: What are the top 10 states in which schools gathered most amount of AVERAGE donations for their projects ? 
    3: Investigate the maximum, minimum, mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles of "Donation Amount" column. 
    4: What is the average donation amount across all projects ? 
    5: What are the minimum and maximums ?
    6: In which states there are more donations done by donors. 
    7: Is there a relationship between the number of projects offered and number of donations made by the donors. Which states performing better in this case ? 
    8: How many of them responding project requests below average and which states are performing best in terms of donations per project ? 
    9: How many different project types exists?  What is the total donation amount for each of them ? 
    10: How many project subject category trees exists ? Which ones attracted the most donations ? 
    11: What is the mean time that takes a project to be fully funded after posted and how it varies between states ?
    12: In which 10 states project funded earlier than average days ?
 
## Analysis:

You can consult the code to answer this questions on the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository.

## Visualization:

In order to get a more compreensive representation of the results I created some plots in the Jupyter Notebook.
